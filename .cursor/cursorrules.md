This is a personal book tracking app called My Bookshelf.

Stack:
- Backend: Node.js + Express, CommonJS (require/module.exports)
- Frontend: React + Vite, JSX
- Database: PostgreSQL on Render
- AI: Anthropic SDK, model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- Deployed on Render, auto-deploys from GitHub on push to main

Style:
- Dark theme: background #0f0e0c, surfaces #1a1814, borders #2a2822, text #e8e4dc, muted #9a9488
- Keep backend routes in server/routes/, React pages in client/src/pages/

Rules:
- Always check for syntax errors before finishing
- Never use ES modules (import/export) in server/ files, only require()
- Always test that bracket pairs match on any new functions
- Always update MEMORY.md when discovering a new issue, starting work on an issue, or completing one. Be concise — minimal edits only, preserve existing formatting.
- When debugging API lookup pipelines (covers/fan art/import), prefer structured step-by-step debug payloads and provide a single-click copy button in UI when practical.
